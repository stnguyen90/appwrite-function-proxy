## ‚ú® Features

- Transforms generic requests to [create an Appwrite Function Execution](https://appwrite.io/docs/client/functions?sdk=web-default#functionsCreateExecution).
- One proxy can be used to execute any project's function for the configured Appwrite instance

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

### Setup

1. Deploy using a button üëÜ
2. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`: Appwrite endpoint
   - `APPWRITE_PROJECTS`: comma separated project IDs to allow using this proxy

### Executing

To proxy your request to Appwrite, send a `POST` request to `https://[DOMAIN]/api/projects/{project_id}/functions/{function_id}/executions` with:

1. your Appwrite API Key as the Authorization Bearer token for authentication
2. your data as the request body

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://$DOMAIN/projects/$PROJECT_ID/functions/$FUNCTION_ID/executions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $APPWRITE_API_KEY" \
    -d '{"x": 1}'
```
